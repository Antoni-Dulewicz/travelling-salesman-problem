What is simulated annealing?
</font>

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. To find the solution to a problem, it explores the solution space by randomly selecting a solution and then accepting or rejecting it based on a probability distribution function. The probability distribution function is determined by the current temperature and the difference between the current solution and the new solution. The temperature is gradually decreased over time, which allows the algorithm to escape local minima and explore the solution space more thoroughly. Simulated annealing is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to increase its strength and reduce defects. Similarly, in simulated annealing, the algorithm starts with a high temperature and then gradually cools down to find the optimal solution to the problem.

I added functionality to reheat the system if the algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum. This allows the algorithm to escape the local minimum and continue exploring the solution space. This is how this functionality works:
